      <h2>Air Conditioning</h2>
      <p>
        A traditional home comfort system has two parts: an indoor unit, such as
        a furnace or air handler, and an outdoor unit. An air conditioner is the
        outdoor unit that cools air and sends it to the indoor unit for
        circulation through your home. Indoor and outdoor units are designed to
        work together. When the air conditioner is properly matched with a
        furnace or air handler, you get maximum efficiency and longer system
        life.
      </p>
      <h2>Furnaces</h2>

      <p>
        Furnaces heat and circulate warm air in the winter. Furnace heating
        ability is measured with an Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE)
        percentage. A higher AFUE percentage indicates a more efficient furnace.
      </p>

      <h2>High-Efficiency Heat Pumps</h2>

      <p>
        A split system heat pump keeps homes comfortable all year long. In
        summer, it draws heat out of your home to cool it. In the winter, it
        draws heat from outside air into your home to warm it.
      </p>

      <h2>Heating and Cooling Systems</h2>
      <p>
        In a packaged system, all equipment is built into an outdoor unit,
        usually on a concrete slab or other platform. The 'package' that gives
        it its name provides central air conditioning during the summer and heat
        in colder months.
      </p>

      <h2>Thermostats</h2>
      <p>
        Thermostats are extremely important because they are your interface and
        control system for your heating and air conditioning equipment. This is
        the device that will give you the information on what the equipment is
        doing, when it needs to be serviced, and allows you to set the exact
        temperature and humidity you want to maintain in your home.
      </p>
      <h2>Zoning</h2>
      <p>
        Zoning allows you to have different temperatures in each room or area of
        your house. You can have one temperature in the kitchen, another
        temperature in the family room, another temperature in your bedroom,
        etc. Not only does this provide much more comfort but it can save
